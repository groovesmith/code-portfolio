# Developer Showcase

This repository contains a collection of software projects and coding exercises 
that demonstrate my skills as a developer.  

The projects cover different technologies (e.g. Angular, TypeScript, .NET, C#) 
and illustrate principles like clean code, SOLID, testing, and good architecture.  

Each project lives in its own folder with a README that explains its purpose, 
how to run it, and which concepts or technologies it demonstrates.
